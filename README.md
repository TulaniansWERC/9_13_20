# 9_13_18: Introduction to R - by Tulane University R Fans (TURF)

Materials and resources from our meeting on September 13, 2018. 

This meeting introduced members to the R environment, and using R for data analysis.

## Prerequisites

Users will require R and R studio, as well as an internet connection to use some of the commands in the guide.

## Contents

9_13_18 : The project file for the meeting. Start by opening this.

Alterniflora : Vegetation data for use in the BasicCommands script.

BasicCommands : An R script that will guide members through a short tutorial on using R for data analysis.

password_generator : A more advanced script written by Steve Formel, illustrating R functionality.

Patens : Vegetation data for use in the BasicCommands script.

WelcometoTurf: Powerpoint slides that were shown at the beginning of the meeting.

## How to use these files

Download this entire folder and extract the contents on your home computer.

If you have installed both R and R Studio, you can open this project by opening the R Project file "9_13_18". This should load the "BasicCommands" and "password_generator" R scripts. Users who are new to R should read and follow the intstructions in "BasicCommands". We will build off of these skills at the next TURF meeting. "password_generator" contains functions that were not covered in our meeting and is just for fun.
